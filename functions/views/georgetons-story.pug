      h2 Volunteering with Heart of Heart International

    .paragraph

      p Georgeton Charles is a graduate of Wilmington University of
        | Delaware with a Master of Business: Organizational Leadership degree.
        | Born and raised in Leogane, Haiti, he came to the United States after
        | serving as an interpreter for Heart to Heart International, a
        | volunteer team of medical professionals who assisted victims of the
        | 2010 earthquake in Haiti. Two of the nurses whom he assisted
        | offered Georgeton an opportunity to come to the US to pursue a college
        | education which he began at Cumberland County College.

        h2 Supporting students in Haiti
    
    .paragraph-right
      P Georgeton’s passion for education has led him to establish a locally-based 
        | nonprofit organization to help children in Haiti afford tuition, books, and
        | uniforms required for public education. The organization “Another Haiti”
        | conducts fundraising locally and each August, the team of local volunteers
        | whom Georgeton has recruited travels to Leogane to work with the students
        | and to conduct an art/essay contest in which around 200 students compete
        | for scholarships

      h2 Valuable employer 

    .paragraph
      P Georgeton himself experienced the hardship of having to sit out a year
        | of high school so that his older brother could attend. He used that year
        | as an opportunity to apprentice as a tailor and learned a very valuable
        | trade. The following year he went back to school and earned his diploma.
        | He has since founded, built, and after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti,
        | rebuilt a successful tailoring business in his home town that employs
        | five people.

        h2 Continuing to support Haiti 

    .paragraph-right
      P Georgeton believes that Haiti won’t be going anywhere without being
        | self-sustainable. Haiti, his home country depends on the mercy of other
        | countries since almost the beginning of times. He created “Le Moto” a
        | small leasing motorcycle to help tackle this issues.  “Le Moto” is
        | currently employs 27 people and ready to grow.

      P Helping his people in Haiti, however, will always be his highest calling in life.
